# MoodBoxController
The control app for my Mood Box project.

## üí° Inspiration
I'm always looking to expand my skill set and knowledge, thus I decided to tackle hardware by building the Mood Box. 

## ‚ö° What it does
The Mood Box Controller app controls the mood box that I made by sending information through Bluetooth signals. The app allows the allows the user to control the colors that the mood box will display and control the pattern that the colors are shown in.

## üî® How I built it
* UI Design: Figma
* Software: Android Studio (XML/Java)
* Mood Box Hardware: Onshape (3D Modeling), Ardunio, Lasercutting Machine 

## üèÜ Challenges I ran into
Initially, since I was new to hardware and Bluetooth communication, it was a bit challenging for me at first to build the project (both the hardware and software). It took me some time to understand the fundamentals of electronics, but it was worth it because the experience and the knowledge gained was great!

## üèÜ Accomplishments that I am proud of
Looking at where I was a couple years ago and where I am now in terms of the projects I've done, I'm really happy and this project is one of the ones that make my learning journey so great.

## üß† What I learned
I learned how to use Ardunios, Bluetooth modules, and 3D modeling software (Onshape). I hope to use this knowledge for other future projects!
